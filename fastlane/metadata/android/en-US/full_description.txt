<big><b>Features:</b></big>

<b>My Location</b> finds your device's location in the following ways:

<b>-</b> <b>GPS</b> is usually the most accurate method. But a position fix may take some time or may not work at all due to signal loss. <b>Lock GPS</b> feature runs a persistent service to keep connected with the satellites.

You can also see the list of visible satellites with their PRNs (unique identifiers) and SNR (signal quality).

<b>-</b> <b>Network Location Provider</b> uses Wi-Fi or Cellular ids to estimate the location. On the devices with Google Play Services installed, NLP usually uses Google Location Service at backend.

<b>-</b> <b>UnifiedNLP</b> is an open source API which has been used to develop multiple NLP backends (https://github.com/microg/UnifiedNlp/wiki/Backends).

<b>Furthermore:</b>

<b>-</b> Location coordinates can be copied to clipboard or opened in a maps app, if installed.

<b>-</b> Clearing A-GPS aiding data is also supported.

My Location is completely <b>free</b> and <b>open-source</b>. No ads, no trackers, no analytics.
